# Organisations

Organisatons are isolated spaces where you can add multiple `workspaces` and `members` in NodeScript. An organsiation acts as a billing entity as any credits assigned to your account are assigned to an organisation and used across all `workspaces` within it.

Only the members of a organisation have access to the `workspaces`, `endpoints` and `graphs` within it, content can not be shared across organisations.

## Adding an new Organisation

When you first sign up for NodeScript are prompted to choose your organisation type, either a `Personal` or a `Team`. This setting can be changed at any time in the organsiation settings.

As their names suggest, a personal orgnaisation is for a single user and a team or allows for multiple team members to be added. 

### Adding additional organisation
A new Organisation can be added at any time by selecting `Add new` from the organisation dropdown menu in the NavBar.

## Inviting new members
