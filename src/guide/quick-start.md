# Quick Start

You are 5 minutes away from creating your first NodeScript endpoint.

## Sign up

First, you need a NodeScript Platform account. You can use one of the following methods for signing up:

- Login with Google (OAuth)
- Login with GitHub (OAuth)
- Magic link (the sign in link will be sent to your email)

## Organisation

At the first sign up you will be prompted to create an organisation.

In NodeScript everything you create is linked to a particular organisation. This way you can add more people to collaborate with you.

If you don't need to add teammates yet, just proceed with a Personal organisation â€” you can change this at any time in Organisation settings.

## Workspace

Workspaces provide a way to structure your graphs, endpoints, schedules and variables.

This becomes especially relevant when you build multiple applications with a single team.
