# Graphs

Graphs are our canvas for building things in NodeScript. They can contain many connected [nodes](./nodes.md), each performing a specific task or function. By combining nodes in a Graph, you can build complex applications of your logic. 

You'll use the Graph to interact with, create, and manage your workflows or applications by linking nodes in different ways. They are infinitely scrollable and are the main place you will interact with NodeScript. You can zoom in and out of the Graph to orientate yourself.

Graphs give you:

 - **Instant Feedback** - they are evaluated and the intermediate results are displayed.
 - **Composable** - you can combine many Nodes together.
 - **Reusable** - a Graph can be published as a module, allowing its functionality to be used in other graphs.
