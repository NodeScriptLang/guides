# Workspaces

Workspaces are isolated spaces where you can create _graphs_, _endpoints_ and invite other users to join you. You can create _variables_ (either sensitive or non sensitive strings) which can then be used within your graphs by plugging them into your _nodes_.

To create a new workspace, in the sidebar, select the drop down for the workspace you are currently in and press the `Create Workspace` button. Give your workspace a name and create it. Simple.

## Inviting users to your workspace

It's easy to add your friends (or colleagues) to your workspace in NodeScript. It's only tricky when they don't already have an account - but they can sort that out easily; they just need to sign up.

Use the Workspace menu to access your workspace `Settings`, click through to `Members`, press `Add Member` and enter their username. 

## Creating and managing endpoints

You can find all your endpoints in the `Endpoints` sidebar. Endpoints can be very powerful and flexible, as you can see [here](./endpoints.md). Before relying on NodeScript for production applications, take some time to plan out your endpoints carefully

## Managing your workspace name

You can update your workspace name by using the `Settings` sidebar and entering a new name for your workspace at any stage.
