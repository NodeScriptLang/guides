# Getting started

In this section, we'll explore the platform's layout and how to navigate the dashboard. Firstly, NodeScript requires no dependencies, configuration or installation, and will run in any browser.

## Sign in

All we need is your email address, which we'll get through GitHub or Google authentication.

To sign in through either of these platforms, just click on the option from the login page and authorize NodeScript to access your account. 

Only your email will be collected.

### Magic Link

Magic Link sign in also available. Enter your email and click the "Sign in with Magic Link" button on the login page to send an email containing a unique link for you to login with. This link will be valid for 1 hour after sending. 

This passwordless process must be repeat on each sign in.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you'll see when signing in to NodeScript. It provides an overview and details of the currently selected workspace (1). You can choose from all available workspaces you have access to using the dropdown menu (2). Whenever you select an item from this page, its relevant information appears in the container to its right.

For example, when you click on Graphs in the Workspace navigation (3), a list of all saved graphs in the current workspace will be displayed in the center container (4). Then, if you select a graph from this list, its data will be shown in the right container (5).
