# Introduction

Welcome to NodeScript! We're here to help you automate workflows and integrate APIs easier than ever before. Think of NodeScript as your go-to for connecting APIs and online services without needing to dive deep into coding.

Our interface is pretty straightforward, so you can set up, tweak, and keep an eye on your workflows without hassle. Its collaborative, always running and requires no set up. We're all about making integration and automation as simple and user-friendly as possible.

## How does it work?

At its core, NodeScript is a node-based visual programming language that enables users to create flow-based [graphs](./graphs.md), which can then be executed in real-world scenarios through an [endpoint](./endpoints.md). Here is a quick intro video to show you the basics:

<style>
  .video_container {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* Aspect ratio 16:9 */
    right: 40px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .video_container iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }

  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .video_container {
      padding-bottom: 75%; /* Aspect ratio 4:3 for smaller screens */
    }
  }
</style>

The functionality and scope of your graph are entirely up to you. NodeScript offers an infinitely scalable canvas that can accommodate as many [nodes](nodes.md) as you need!

The power of NodeScript comes from a few key features. Firstly, the ability to see the result of your node structure as you are building it - The results are displayed above the nodes you can see the data you are getting and adjust and iterate as you go. Our aim is to remove any unknowns in your development process and allow you to build quickly.

Next is the ability to publish a graph as a module and then call in into other graphs. This allows you to pack huge amounts of complexity into just a few node connections. Along with the ability to deploy HTTP endpoints, webhooks, or scheduled tasks directly within these graphs, this creates powerful and reusable workflows in a very simple interface.

Finally the fact that you can build these graphs of scaling complexity and expose them an endpoint without any dev ops or environment set up. Its a far more powerful tool set than a standard integration platform, you just have to know how to use it.

### Key Features & Capabilities: ###

- Always ready - no setup needed
- Always running - no hosting required
- Immediate feedback without deployment
- Collaborative environment for team projects
- Composable elements for versatile creations

### Why NodeScript? ###

- Real-time results - see the outcomes as you develop
- Speed - at scale, it's faster than traditional coding
- Atomic design - modular components for flexibility
- Instant work and deployment - save time and effort
- Automated API calls - no more manual interventions
- Accessibility - suitable for developers of all skill levels

### Quick Glossary: ###

- **Graph**: A visual representation of a workflow or process, made up of interconnected nodes.
- **Node**: The fundamental building blocks in a graph that execute specific tasks.
- **Endpoint**: The URL or location where the graph's output can be accessed or triggered.
- **Module**: A reusable graph or subset of nodes encapsulated as a single unit in NodeScript. Modules allow for the encapsulation of specific logic or functionality, making it easier to incorporate into larger workflows without redundancy.
